Title: Two-Player Number Guessing Game

Description:
A fun and interactive two-player number guessing game built with JavaScript! The first player sets a secret number (between 1 and 12), while the second player tries to guess it within three attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, and if the player fails to guess correctly, the first player wins! Simple yet engaging, this project strengthens JavaScript skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and input validation.

Features:
1. Two-player mode |
2. Input validation for names and numbers |
3. Three attempts to guess the number |
4. Dynamic UI updates without page reload |
